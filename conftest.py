"""Repo-wide pytest configuration.

DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH (2026-07): the primary fix for real Windows desktop toasts
firing during test runs lives in tools/notify_ops.py::notify_desktop, which
no-ops whenever PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST is set (pytest sets this automatically for
every test). This autouse fixture is a SECOND, independent layer: it also
monkeypatches the known notify entry points to inert capture stubs, so tests
stay silent even in a hypothetical path that bypasses the env-var guard (for
example, a subprocess that does not inherit PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST).

This does not weaken any test assertion: individual tests that want to assert
on notify call content (see relay/test_admission.py) still save the original
attribute, patch it to their own capture list, and restore it in a finally --
that pattern layers on top of this fixture without conflict, since this
fixture's stub is just a (harmless) no-op capture, not the real emitter.

# The kill-switch is a file under the account's home, so every checkout and every server
# instance running as one user shares one global switch. While the in-process stop path was
# broken this was invisible -- contract_gate's stop was silently refused, so a test that
# tripped a destructive op_class set nothing. The moment that path worked, such a test left
# the switch ON: the next run reported six unrelated scenarios as ABORTED, and the report
# blamed the scenarios.
#
# Set BEFORE tools.gate_ops is imported, which is why it is at module scope in conftest
# rather than in a fixture -- the module reads the variable once, at import.
